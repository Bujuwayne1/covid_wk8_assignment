# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description

This project aims to build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. By analyzing cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time, learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools. The final deliverable is a data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

## Project Objectives

* Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
* Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
* Compare metrics between countries/regions.
* Visualize trends with charts and maps.
* Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report.

## Project Segments (Step-by-Step Guide)

### 1. Data Collection

* **Goal:** Obtain a reliable COVID-19 dataset.
* **Data Sources:**
    * [Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset (CSV & API)](<Link to OWID Dataset - You'll need to find the actual link>) - **Recommended for beginners: Use the cleaned CSV from Our World in Data (easy to load with pandas).**
    * [Johns Hopkins University GitHub Repository](<Link to JHU Repository - You'll need to find the actual link>)
* **Action:**
    * Download `owid-covid-data.csv` from the Our World in Data link.
    * Save it in your working folder.

### 2. Data Loading & Exploration

* **Goal:** Load the dataset and explore its structure.
* **Tasks:**
    * Load data using `pandas.read_csv()`.
    * Check columns: `df.columns`.
    * Preview rows: `df.head()`.
    * Identify missing values: `df.isnull().sum()`.
* **Tools:**
    * pandas
* **Key columns:** `date`, `location`, `total_cases`, `total_deaths`, `new_cases`, `new_deaths`, `total_vaccinations`, etc.

### 3. Data Cleaning

* **Goal:** Prepare data for analysis.
* **Tasks:**
    * Filter countries of interest (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).
    * Drop rows with missing dates/critical values.
    * Convert the date column to datetime: `pd.to_datetime()`.
    * Handle missing numeric values with `fillna()` or `interpolate()`.
* **Tools:**
    * pandas

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Goal:** Generate descriptive statistics & explore trends.
* **Tasks:**
    * Plot total cases over time for selected countries.
    * Plot total deaths over time.
    * Compare daily new cases between countries.
    * Calculate the death rate: `total_deaths / total_cases`.
    * [Further EDA tasks as you discover interesting aspects of the data]
* **Visualizations:**
    * Line charts (cases & deaths over time).
    * Bar charts (top countries by total cases).
    * Heatmaps (optional for correlation analysis).
* **Tools:**
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn

### 5. Visualizing Vaccination Progress

* **Goal:** Analyze vaccination rollouts.
* **Tasks:**
    * Plot cumulative vaccinations over time for selected countries.
    * Compare % vaccinated population.
* **Charts:**
    * Line charts.
    * Optional: Pie charts for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.
* **Tools:**
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn

### 6. Optional: Build a Choropleth Map

* **Goal:** Visualize cases or vaccination rates by country on a world map.
* **Tools:**
    * Plotly Express
    * Or geopandas (advanced)
* **Tasks:**
    * Prepare a dataframe with `iso_code`, `total_cases` (or vaccination data) for the latest date.
    * Plot a choropleth showing case density or vaccination rates.

### 7. Insights & Reporting

* **Goal:** Summarize findings.
* **Tasks:**
    * Write 3-5 key insights from the data (e.g., "X country had the fastest vaccine rollout").
    * Highlight anomalies or interesting patterns.
    * Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook to write your narrative.
* **Deliverables:**
    * A well-documented Jupyter Notebook combining:
        * Code
        * Visualizations
        * Narrative explanations
    * Optional export: Notebook $\rightarrow$ PDF or a PowerPoint with screenshots.

## Recommended Tools

* Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
* pandas
* matplotlib & seaborn
* Optional: plotly & geopandas

**How to use this README:**

1.  **Save it as `README.md`** in the main directory of your project (the same folder where your Jupyter Notebook and potentially the data file will reside).
2.  **Replace the bracketed links** (`<Link to OWID Dataset>`, etc.) with the actual URLs. You can find the Our World in Data dataset link by searching on their website. If you use the Johns Hopkins data or a Kaggle dataset, include those links as well.
3.  **As you progress through the project**, you might want to add more details or refine the descriptions in the README. For example, you could briefly mention any interesting insights you've found.

This README provides a good overview of your project based on the images you shared. It outlines the steps, goals, tools, and expected deliverables, making it easy for someone (including yourself in the future) to understand the project's scope and execution.
